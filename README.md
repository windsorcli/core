## Purpose

The Windsor CLI is designed to streamline the cloud-native developer experience. Built in Go, it runs seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Windsor addresses several challenges common in building and running software platforms by integrating various tools into a cohesive workflow:

- **Complete Local Cloud**: Simulates complete cloud-native infrastructure locally using a native virtualization platform (currently supports Colima).
- **Support Services**: Push and pull containers to local image registries, and browse your local services at `*.local.test` domains.
- **Livereload GitOps**: Reflects your source via a local git repository, enabling you to work with GitOps tooling locally.
- **Contextual Workflow**: Code once, deploy-to-many with an elegant contextual workflow, dynamically reconfiguring your toolchain as you target different deployment environments.
