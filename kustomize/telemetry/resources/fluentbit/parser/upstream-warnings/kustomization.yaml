# Upstream warning suppressor
# Downgrades known third-party deprecation warnings to TRACE severity
#
# These are warnings from upstream components (OpenEBS, etc.) that use
# deprecated Kubernetes APIs. We can't fix the upstream code, but we can
# reduce log noise by downgrading these known-harmless warnings.
#
# To add new patterns: edit upstream-warnings.lua SUPPRESS_PATTERNS table
